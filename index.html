        <p>I've always been fascinated by technology, and web development has become a major part of my life. It all started with my curiosity about how websites work and how I could build my own. After spending countless hours learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for the art and science of web design. My passion for web development grew as I realized the endless possibilities of what I could create—whether it was a simple landing page or a complex interactive website. As I honed my skills, I began experimenting with more advanced topics like responsive design, animations, and user experience, each adding a new layer of understanding to my knowledge.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was finding the balance between functionality and aesthetics. I learned that good design is not just about making things look appealing but also ensuring that they are intuitive and easy to use. This course, INFO 2180, has been instrumental in helping me structure my learning path, providing me with the necessary foundation to build websites effectively. I’m continually exploring new frameworks and libraries to expand my skill set and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of web development. As I continue on this journey, I’m excited to see how I can blend creativity and technology to build impactful digital experiences.</p>

        <p>Arsenal Football Club has been my favorite team for as long as I can remember. From the historic moments under Arsène Wenger to the modern-day excitement of watching young talents emerge, being an Arsenal fan has always been an emotional rollercoaster. Supporting Arsenal goes beyond just watching football matches; it’s a shared passion that brings fans together from all over the world. Whether celebrating victories or enduring defeats, the connection I have with the team and fellow fans makes the journey worthwhile. Every match day is filled with anticipation and suspense.</p>
        <p>What I admire most about Arsenal is their commitment to nurturing young talent and playing a style of football that prioritizes skill and creativity. Despite the challenges and criticisms, the club’s philosophy remains true to its roots, focusing on playing beautiful, attacking football. Players like Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp, and more recently, Bukayo Saka, have left an indelible mark on the club’s legacy. The highs and lows of supporting Arsenal have taught me patience and loyalty.I look forward to witnessing more unforgettable moments and hope to see Arsenal return to the pinnacle of football glory soon. Being an Arsenal fan means believing in the process and staying committed, no matter the outcome.</p>>
